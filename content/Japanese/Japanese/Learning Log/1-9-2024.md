I learned a bit about ござる and ございまする/ござりまする

I’m still not sure what the 十 昭和四十に年 represents or what kind of fortune it is other than the obvious translation.
>***The way I understood it (and I very well might be wrong) was that the “winner” was any 10-yen coin from the 42nd year of the Showa era.***


# Prologue translation
There was a rattling noise. It was the sound of an octagonal lottery box turning.  
With a clatter, a ball about the size of a pachinko ball spilled out. A shiny, bright copper-coloured ball. On its surface “10 Showa 42” was engraved in tiny characters.  
Someone’s fingers picked up the ball.  
“Today’s lucky treasure is a Showa 42 ten-yen coin? How lovely. Hopefully a customer carrying the treasure comes in.”  
The cheerful, calm murmur filled the interior of the small shop.

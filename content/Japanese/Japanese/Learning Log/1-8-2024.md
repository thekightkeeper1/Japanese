Starting [[銭天堂 - Zenitendou]]。Using the [booksclub for vocab](https://community.wanikani.com/t/%E9%8A%AD%E5%A4%A9%E5%A0%82-%E3%83%BB-zenitendou-the-mysterious-sweet-shop-beginner-book-club/35781) and I plan to add all the vocab that I learn into anki. I think im just going to stick to wanikani for vocab? i dont reallyknow, i guess that I will figure it all out. I also think that I might write down the sentences in my notebook as I go to get practice writing.

I learned about how　敬語　adjectives are all conjugated so that instead of ending with い, they end in う. The trick is that a あう sound goes into おう. Eg, お早う. Its はいやい　⇒　はいよう
